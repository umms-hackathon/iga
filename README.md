**4. Aim: ** 

C. elegans is a powerful model organism enabling
researchers to understand genome. Although itâ€™s genome
sequence and genomic elements are mostly known, repetitive
elements are not well-documented. For example, although
annotated in just one genomic region, C23H5.6 pseudogene is
found to be existing in 96 different places in the genome with
minor sequence differences. Therefore, better annotation of
repetitive elements improves our understanding and prevents
misleading results.

**5. Project description:**

First phase of the project involves identifying other copies of
genes, pseudogenes, rRNAs, tRNAs, and piRNAs. In the second
phase, naming and representation of these extra copies creates a
challenge since they add extra complexity when assigning NGS
reads to multiple copies. Next task is to visualize these multicopy
elements in the 100 million bp - long genome in order to
reveal patterns or specific regions of the genome. Lastly, putting
things together as an interactive web-based tool allowing user to
filter items is the major goal of the project.
